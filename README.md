# Plan Colombia

This repository hold the Data Sets used for my Plan Colombia analysis. 

You can find a description of Plan Colombia here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Colombia

The main goal of this analysis was to determine if Plan Colombia has reached its initial goals: reduce cocaine production in Colombia, seize larger amounts of cocaine going to the US, and reduce consumption of cocaine in the US population. I also examined the trend of people reporting to have been less active due to cocaine use. 

The Data for this analysis came from several different sources:

Crops Data from the UNODC: https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/crop-monitoring/index.html?tag=Colombia

Seized Cocaine from the UNODC: https://data.unodc.org/#state:11

Drug Use in the USA from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. I downloaded the results of the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for every year starting on 1994 and ending on 2014. The datasets can be found here:  https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/index.jsp
