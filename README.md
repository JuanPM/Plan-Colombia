# Plan Colombia

This repository hold the Data Sets used for my Plan Colombia analysis. 

You can find a description of Plan Colombia here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Colombia

The main goal of this analysis was to determine if Plan Colombia has reached its initial goals: reduce cocaine production in Colombia, seize larger amounts of cocaine going to the US, and reduce consumption of cocaine in the US population. I also examined the trend of people reporting to have been less active due to cocaine use. 

The Data for this analysis came from several different sources:

Crops Data from the UNODC: https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/crop-monitoring/index.html?tag=Colombia

Seized Cocaine from the UNODC: https://data.unodc.org/#state:11

Drug Use in the USA from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. I downloaded the results of the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for every year starting on 1994 and ending on 2014. The datasets can be found here:  https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/index.jsp

A short description and analysis of the results:
In the image it is possible to see the trends for coca leaf crops, seizures of cocaine shipments leaving Colombia, seizures of cocaine shipments entering the USA, and reported cocaine use data. 
I analyzed data for the 5 year period before Plan Colombia started, as well as data for the entire duration of the program (it ended in 2015). 
I have also included a line plot showing the trend of the number of people in the USA reporting to have been less active over the last year, due to cocaine use.
On the data it is possible to see that Plan Colombia reduced the number of coca leaf crops from its peak in 2000. That is probably due to the aerial fumigation campaigns carried out in the early 2000s. The number of crops has, however, once again increased in recent times (https://www.wsj.com/articles/coca-cultivation-in-colombia-reaches-new-high-1529954782). So the plan has clearly not had a lasting effect. 
It is also possible to see that seizure of cocaine shipments in Colombia and the US have increased, although the US seems to have only started taking the issue seriously in 2005 (5 years after the start of Plan Colombia). 
Finally it the self reported cocaine use over the period between 1994 and 2014 is also shown. It can bee seen that although cocaine use in 2012-2014 shows a decreasing trend, the levels are about the same as those when Plan Colombia started. Also a t-test comparison shows there is no statistically significant difference between then self reported cocaine use levels before and after Plan Colombia was in place (p = 0.88). On average, approximately 53,000 surveys were gathered for each year in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. 
As an interesting aside, the number of people that report being less active due to cocaine use did decrease over the period between 2002 and 2014. 
In general, I would conclude from this analysis that Plan Colombia did not have a lasting and significant effect on the number of coca leaf crops in Colombia and it did not significantly impact cocaine use in the USA. 
More recent data seems to corroborate this conclusion: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/04/colombias-coca-boom-is-showing-up-on-u-s-streets/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ebc66e754a89
